[Focus](https://focus.gaunt.dev) is a tool I've been using to keep myself
focused on tasks throughout the day as well as keep track on what I've been
working on each week.

<p class="u-center"><a class="c-btn" href="https://focus.gaunt.dev">Try Focus Here</a></p>

## Why?

Despite working from home before the pandemic, I was really struggling to
keep focused and after trying a few approaches, I found the 3 tasks a day an
extremely helpful way to focus myself.

Over time I'm hoping to add features to focus to help plan quarters and
weeks, but for now it's more focused on the daily tasks.

## Should you use it?

Feel free to give it a try! It's open to anyone with a Google Account.

I find using [Focus](https://focus.gaunt.dev) along with the
[Pin-It Extension](/projects/pin-it/) a light weight way to track my work
and help me direct myself each day.
