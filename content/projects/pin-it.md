## Why?

Do you like having e-mail, slack, calendar, and other sites open while you work?

If so, this extension is for you! Never forget to open a website or forget

on the extension icon, it'll set your pinned tabs to your sites.

## How?

### Step 1

Download the extension from the
[Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pin-it/iaebojjjijdaeinlldahkekclhdjgkme)

### Step 2

Open the options page for the Pin-It extension.
