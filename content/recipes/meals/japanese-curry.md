1. Increase heat to medium-low and let the current simmer uncovered for 5-10
   minutes, stirring to prevent sticking and mix in the curry cubes.

## Storage

1. You can keep the leftovers in a glass airtight container (so no stains!)
1. Refrigerate: Up to 3 days
1. Freeze: Up to 1 month
    - The texture of the potatoes will change in the freezer, so you should take
      them out before freezing. Defrost the frozen curry in the refrigerator
      for 24 hours before you want to reheat it.

## Reheat

1. Add a little broth (1/4 to 1/2 cup) to the curry in a pot
1. Reheat of medium-low heat
1. If the curry is too thick, add a little more broth. If the curry is too
   watery, leave to simmer uncovered.
