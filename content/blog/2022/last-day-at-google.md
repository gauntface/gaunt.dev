# Leaving Google

Today is my last day at Google.

It's a mix of feelings after handing in my resignation. I'm grateful for all of
the opportunities Google has given me, yet there is a strong sense of relief
getting to step back.

Over the past 10 years, I've worked with several teams, had numerous roles,
traveled the world, met many incredible people, and moved to the US.

There's no one single reason for my departure. The combination of burnout
during a pandemic, getting my green card approved, aligning my job role to
software engineer, and getting married in the past year has meant I'm in a
position where I want and can look to the future for what I want next and I'd
like to be outside of Google.

I don't have a new role lined up; I'm planning on taking the next few months
off, spending it celebrating my marriage with family who I've not seen in
years, going on a honeymoon, followed by a month for myself to reflect on
what I'd like to focus on next (a big thank you to Ashley for supporting me).

As a memento, here is a playlist of videos from my time at Google.
