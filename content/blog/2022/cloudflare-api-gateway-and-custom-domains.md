# Cloudflare, AWS API Gateway & Custom Domains

I've been playing with AWS Lambda on and off for a while, using SAM to
deploy my lambda and access it through a custom domain.

Everything had been working fine until I recently changed the naming
of my API gateway and switched from a `RestAPI` to a `HttpAPI` for my
lambda functions.

My functions would work when I called them through the *Invoke URL*, however
if I tried calling the same lambda function via the *API Gateway domain name*
or via the custom domain name, I would get no response or a "Not Found" error.

```
{"message":"Not Found"}
```

Somewhere in my changes, possibly to do with the move to `HttpAPI`, the issue
was the configuration of Cloudflare.

I have my SSL/TLS set to "Flexible" because I have sites hosted via S3,
however, my API Gateway needed this to be "Full" to work.

If you can switch your default to "Full" that may solve your problems. For
me I had to create a "Rule" in Cloudflare so that all requests to the API
Gateway would use "Full" encryption.

The rule I used was `focus-api*.gaunt.dev/*`, and the settings were `SSL` and
`Full`.
