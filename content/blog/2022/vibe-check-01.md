# Vibe Check ‚Ññ1

Ever since [Dave Rupert](https://twitter.com/davatron5000) started doing [vibe checks](https://daverupert.com/2021/02/vibe-check-1/)
I've wanted to start doing them if nothing else beyond forcing myself to
write blog posts more frequently, so here we are.

> No goals, only vibes

- ü´† I've started a new job at [Sentry](http://sentry.io/), joining the developer
  infrastructure team. It's the start of week three, and I'm enjoying it and slowly figuring stuff out.

    - It has been interesting using Sentry on my site to track
      performance. Making minor tweaks and seeing the result a week later
      on real-world users is helpful.

- üè® Last month, I attended DefCon for the first time. It was also my
  first conference since the pandemic started. It was a great experience and a well-run conference. I'm on my way to believing that all conference events should have [goons](https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-goons.html).

    - I picked up a bunch of different devices at DefCon and having fun learning
      what you can do with 'em.

- üåç Couple of random things I've liked from the interwebs:

    - `git add -p` from [evanpurkhiser](https://gist.github.com/evanpurkhiser/1fb880ca14a7c2a35be05d4eeceeba9f)
        - Steps you through each section of a change you are adding to a commit.
    - Add cat gifs to your Pull Request approvals from [codewithanthony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rDNJvHznrM&t=4s)
        - Fun addition to pull request approvals. I want to come up with my own set of gifs.
    - [GitHub Notifier Extension](https://github.com/sindresorhus/notifier-for-github)
        - This has been super helpful to keep on top of GitHub events at Sentry.

### üì∫ TV Shows

I watch too much TV.

- Pen15
    - A cringe and loveable comedy show following two young women navigating high school.
- What we do in the shadows (TV Show)
    - The TV show is fantastic and worth a watch, especially if you liked the movie!

### üïπÔ∏è Video Games

I don't play video games that much, but I have become obsessed with
[Cult of Lamb](https://www.cultofthelamb.com/). It's a mix of animal crossing,
a simple platform game with a big swig of satanic rituals.

### üìö Books

- The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho
    - So far, it's been an enjoyable read. It nudges me to re-think life/how to process events.
- Pretty Deadly by Kelly Sue DeConnick
    - Beautiful artwork and great story mixing gods of death with living and
      dying people.
- Dorohedoro by Q Hayashida
    - Loved this! I ripped through this on the flight to DefCon.
    - Two friends are hunting wizards to prevent them from harming people; meanwhile, the wizards are trying to find and kill them.
    - I'm patiently waiting for the second volume be get back in stock at my local comic book store.

### üé® Crafts

- In August, I went to a delightful wood-turning class, although it was too easy to destroy my work.

- Ashley's been asking for some plant stakes to help keep them in check, so after getting some rough designs down, we made a couple of versions (below is what I've called the halo design).

- I ended up using some of the spare plastic to play with, making a new case for my [nugget](https://retia.io/products/wi-fi-nugget-s2-nugget-esp32s2).

- This month, I've been doing a pottery wheel throwing class, and it's been nice to get back into it; we'll have to see what the results are in a month or so.
