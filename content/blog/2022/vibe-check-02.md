# Vibe Check №2

A difficult month for sure. Family events eclipsing most things, but I did get the joy of looking after [Luna the
delightful pitty](https://twitter.com/rob_dodson/status/1582068042573303808) while my better half was off traveling.

I'm hoping that once I'm back home I can focus more on exercise. The past month has been unkind on a lot of fronts
so focusing on my health will help a great deal.

- 🫠 [Sentry](http://sentry.io/) still feels like a blur but I'm getting more comfortable with things as the weeks
    go by. The primary focus at the moment is replacing the continous deployment tooling and it's looking like
    it'll be a large simiplification over the current process.

  - Python is still a big learning curve but getting more familiar with testing is relieving some of the
    concerns
  - K8s learning is happening, still a large portion of black magic though.
  - Sentry encourages conversations between IC's and managers in a way this is extremely methodical
    and IMO removes a great of ambiguity from a review process:
    - IC rates their levels on a range of topics/skills/areas
    - Manager rates the IC's levels on the same topics/skills/areas
    - The IC and manager then discuss where there are misalignments, come to an agreement on level
          and use it as a way to understand growth opportunities.

- 💻 There were a few things I ended up noodling on in my spare time.

  - [Switched my site over to a different approach](https://github.com/gauntface/go-html-asset-manager/commit/fd47dfb4cbab21a3814f348b8bb6cb1af1af0413)
    for async loading CSS (This was recommended by [Filament Group](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/load-css-simpler/).
  - An AWS Lambda/SAM project stopped building locally and after some digging
    [I got it back up and running](https://www.gaunt.dev/blog/2022/glibc-error-with-aws-sam-and-go/) by telling SAM to use
    a Makefile.
  - Lastly, I ended up adding a mouse jiggler into my [macropad](https://twitter.com/gauntface/status/1398416239098089476)
    to prevent machines from sleeping while working on machines that prevent configuring screen timeouts.

- 🌍 Couple of random things I've liked from the interwebs:

  - I've been using https://www.speedcurve.com/ to track my Lighthouse score and it's a beautiful tool and well worth
    checking out.
  - [Addy posted an interesting tidbit](<img fetchpriority=high>) on configuring hero images with the
    `fetchpriority=high` and it's on my todo list to try out.

### 📺 TV Shows

- Peaky Blinders
  - Not sure why my partner got so into this but it's a good watch.
- Narco-Saints
  - This is a Korean film about a pastor who deals drugs and government agencies are trying to arrest him. Highly recommend it.

### 📚 Books

- Saga Vol. 10!
  - Oh my days what a wait that was. Saga is a fantasy graphic noval and a fantastic story about two people fighting for opposite
      sides of a war and fall in love.

### 🎨 Crafts

- Pottery classes have come to an end, just waiting on the last piece to be fired. Sadly my first ever mug stuck to
  the cookie while being fired. I'll share photos of the successful pieces next time.
