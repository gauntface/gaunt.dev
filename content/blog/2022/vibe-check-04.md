# Vibe Check ‚Ññ4

- ü´† Work has been a struggle. Lots of changes mid-way through a project and
    just generally struggling to find a good use of my time.

    Unfortunately moved off of the current project and have shifted my focus
    to reducing our CI times which has resulted in a lot of digging into python
    tests, jest tests and selenium tests.

- üíª Spent a lot of time traveling so no work on personal projects apart from
     a few small things:

  - Set up [twitterarchive.gaunt.dev](https://twitterarchive.gaunt.dev)
    using [tweetback](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback). Would
    strongly recommend this for anyone want to reduce Twitter usage without
    losing all of this content.

  - Spent some time updating my [Mastodon instance](https://mastodon.gaunt.dev/@matt)
    and surprisingly didn't break anything.

  - [Surma](https://surma.dev/) has been incredibly kind and been reviewing PRs
    as I learn Rust while practicing coding interview questions. ‚ù§Ô∏è

### üì∫ TV Shows

- Alice in Borderlands Season 2
  - Imagine a Saw movie set in Tokyo expect instead of a game focusing on one
    person, it includes an entire city.
- 1866
  - Meh. I enjoyed watching this show but the ending was frustrating.

### üõ´ Travel

- Been travelling in the UK for the first time in years, visiting the lake
  district and Scotland before spending time with family.
