## Work Experience

### Google

###### June 2012 - Current [Staff Developer Programs Engineer]

I originally joined [Google](https://careers.google.com/) as a developer advocate, later became a developer
programs engineer and my current day-to-day focus has shifted from
[advocacy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo4WeLIpjn15yye0FCQRy47YjrrCTh99s)
to software engineering.

##### Engineering Manager

- The [OSPO](https://opensource.google/) (Open Source Programs Office)
engineering team doubled in size and split into two teams. I became the
engineering manager for the compliance team and later took on the GitHub team
as well.
- Required setting priorities for the teams, ensuring our services run smoothly, and ensuring the teams were happy during the pandemic.

##### Open Source Programs Office (OSPO)

- Before joining OSPO in 2019, I had little experience of Google
technologies, having worked predominantly on GitHub. I learned many Google
technologies and shared responsibility in maintaining cron jobs, databases,
websites, and CLI tools.
- One of my primary focuses within the team was educating and encouraging team members to write unit and
integration tests as part of their daily work.
- Working with this team required learning a range of new tools, understanding and
refactoring a large codebase of tools (cron jobs, web servers, CLIs).
- I supported Google's GitHub enterprise plan and incident response teams with planning, tooling, and processes.

##### Workbox

- I worked with the early implementations of service workers, writing
[content](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/smashing-book-5-real-life-responsive-web-design)
on the topic and later became a team lead and core dev for the early
versions of [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox), a set of
libraries and tools that simplify using service workers.

##### Firebase Cloud Messaging

- After working on native
[web push](https://w3c.github.io/push-api/#acknowledgements), I was asked to
lead the design and implementation of the
[Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/products/cloud-messaging)
Web SDK, which required adding support for service workers to the SDK, supporting
long-terms plans in the API design and working with early access partners.
- After its release, I became web platform lead for the Firebase API team,
reviewing new API proposals.

##### Support & Advocacy

- When I first joined Google, I helped several launches, including the
European launch of Google TV and Chromecast as well as the switch to a
Chromium-based WebView in Android.
- These launches required working with Engineers, producing educational
content, working with key partners, and advocating with external communities.

### Future Platforms

###### May 2011 - June 2012 [Software Engineer]

[Future Platforms](https://www.futureplatforms.com/) was a small agency
when I joined in the beautiful city of Brighton, UK.

- Worked in a small team to deliver a range of applications to clients.
- Developed for the Android, iOS, Nokia QT, and Blackberry platforms.
- Worked on a cross-platform framework called KirinJS.
