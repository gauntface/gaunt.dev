## Work Experience

### Google

<div class="c-job-subtitle">June 2012 - April 2022</div>

I originally joined [Google](https://careers.google.com/) as a developer advocate, later became a developer
programs engineer, we promoted several times to staff developer programs enginer and my
day-to-day focus shifted from
[advocacy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo4WeLIpjn15yye0FCQRy47YjrrCTh99s)
to software engineering where I changed my role to senior software engineer.

<div class="c-job-role">December 2019 - January 2022 Engineering Manager</div>

- The [OSPO](https://opensource.google/) (Open Source Programs Office)
engineering team doubled in size and split into two teams. I became the
engineering manager for the compliance team and later took on the GitHub team
as well.
- Required setting priorities for the teams, ensuring our services run smoothly, and ensuring the teams were happy during the pandemic.

<div class="c-job-role">April 2018 - April 2022 Open Source Programs Office (OSPO) [Staff Developer Programs Engineer / Senior Software Engineer</div>

- Became familiar with the "Google tech stack" and shared responsibility in maintaining cron jobs, databases,
websites, and CLI tools.
- One of my primary focuses within the team was educating and fostering a strong testing culture. After education the team increased total coverage by 16% and with presubmit checks the team continued
to improve quality and coverage going forward.
- I supported Google's GitHub enterprise plan and incident response teams with planning, tooling, and processes.

- Workbox
    - I worked with the early implementations of service workers, writing
[a chapter for smashing book 5](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/smashing-book-5-real-life-responsive-web-design)
on the topic and later became a team lead and core dev for the early
versions of [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox), a set of
libraries and tools that simplify using service workers.

- Firebase Cloud Messaging
    - After working on native
[web push](https://w3c.github.io/push-api/#acknowledgements), I was asked to
lead the design and implementation of the
[Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/products/cloud-messaging)
Web SDK, which required adding support for service workers to the SDK, supporting
long-terms plans in the API design and working with early access partners.
    - After its release, I became web platform lead for the Firebase API team, reviewing new API proposals and participating in design reviews.
- Chromium-based WebView in Android
    - Similar to Google TV, this required working with a broad range of stakeholders and users.

- I supported the European launch of Google TV and Chromecast by producing educational
content, working with key partners in early access programs, and advocating with external communities online and presenting at
conferences.
